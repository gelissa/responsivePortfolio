                <p>24 years, 4 months, and 10 days ago, my beautiful parents gave birth to their second child: me! They named me Gelissa and life has been a whirlwind since. 
                    My birthday signifies me as an Aries, and the year I was born was the year of the Ram. That means I can be a stubborn hothead, but since my Meyers-Briggs
                    places me as an INFP, I'm fairly mellow. 
                </p>
                <p>My favorite hobbies include watching movies and reading books. Last year, when Moviepass was still alive and kicking,
                    I managed to go to the theaters nearly every day. It was a blessed time #ripmoviepass. The last five movies I watched were: <i>Lying Lips (1939), 
                        Can You Ever Forgive Me?, High and Low (1963), Happy as Lazzaro, and Princess Cyd
                    </i>. The last book I read was <i>Evicted</i> by Matthew Desmond.
                </p>
                <p>I have always wanted to learn how to code, but my self-teaching has been sporadic. I can't wait to learn as much
                    as I can!
